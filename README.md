The project is about a smart glove that translates ASL (American sign language ) to text and speech using a machine learning model based on random forest algorithms , the model is deployed on a raspberry pi 4 model B  , the glove comes with a esp32 , five fkex sensors and a module that integrates both gyroscope and accelerometer (MPU6050)
